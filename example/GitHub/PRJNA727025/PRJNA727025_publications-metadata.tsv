In the absence of a licensed vaccine, efforts to evaluate prophylactic agents are underway. The prophylactic efficacy of a twice-daily, 550 mg dose of the antibiotic rifaximin demonstrated no efficacy against campylobacteriosis in a controlled human infection model (CHIM); however, samples from the CHIM study were utilized to assess how the human gut microbiome responds to <i>C. jejuni</i> infection, and if a 'protective' microbiota exists in study participants not developing campylobacteriosis. Statistically significant, but minor, differences in study participant beta diversity were identified during the challenge period (p = 0.002, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.042), but no significant differences were otherwise observed. Pre-challenge alpha diversity was elevated in study participants who did not develop campylobacteriosis compared to those who did (p < 0.001), but alpha diversity declined in all study participants from the pre-challenge period to post-discharge. Our work provides insight into gut microbiome shifts observed during a <i>C. jejuni</i> CHIM and following antibiotic treatment. This study utilized a high dose of 1.7 x 10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units of <i>C. jejuni</i>; future work could include CHIM studies performed with inocula more closely mimicking natural exposure as well as field studies involving naturally-occurring enteric infections.	711th Human Performance Wing, Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, OH, United States.	epublish	eng	Electronic-eCollection	Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't;research-article;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.;Journal Article	Campylobacter jejuni;Microbiota;Diarrhea;Human Infection Model;Dysbiosys	Y	Y	N	Y	N	Y	2	Y	Y	Y	N	Y	cc by	Y	bioproject;gen;nct	2021-09-17	2021-09-18	2021-09-16	2021-10-19	2021-08-31	2021-08-31	https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.702047	https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8439579	https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8439579?pdf=render	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/webservices/rest/PMC8439579/fullTextXML	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/webservices/rest/PMC8439579/supplementaryFiles?includeInlineImage=yes	http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_package/9f/7a/PMC8439579.tar.gz
