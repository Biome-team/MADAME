The colonscopic score is a good tool for differentiating the severity of patients with DC. At present, no studies have analyzed the pathogenesis of DC from the perspective of the diversity and and differences of intestinal flora.<h4>Methods</h4>Retrospective study: Clinical information were collected from patients with low rectal cancer admitted to the Department of Anorectal Surgery, Changzheng Hospital, from April 2017 to April 2019. These patients underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection (LAR) combined with terminal ileum enterostomy (dual-chamber). We used chi-square test to comparethe clinical baseline information, clinical symptoms, and colonscopic characteristics between different severity of DC. Propsective oberservational study: We recruited 40 patients with laparoscopic anterior low resection combined with terminal ileum enterostomy and they were further classified into mild group and severe group according to the scores of colonscopic examinations for DC. 16s-rDNA sequencing was carried out to analyze the diversity and and differences of intestinal flora in the intestinal lavage fluid of the two groups.<h4>Results</h4>In retrospective study, we found that age, BMI, history of diabetes, and symptoms associated with the stoma state were the independent risk factors that affect DC severity (<i>P</i><0.05). Meanwhile, age, BMI, history of diabetes and colonscopic score were found to be independent risk factors affecting the severity of diarrhea after ileostomy closure surgery(<i>P<</i>0.05), which was consistent with our results of differentiating the severity of DC under endoscopy; In propsective oberservational study, 40 patients with low rectal cancer recruited by sample size calculation, 23 were in the mild group and 17 in the severe group. The results of 16s-rDNA sequencing showed that intestinal flora with high enrichment values primarily consisted of <i>Bifidobacteriales</i> and <i>Prevotella</i> in mild group, whereas that in the severe group consisted of <i>Providencia</i> and <i>Dorea</i>. The functional predictions on such two types of intestinal flora were mainly focused on lipid synthesis, glycan synthesis, metabolism, and amino acid metabolism pathways.<h4>Conclusion</h4>After ileostomy closure surgery, a series of severe clinical symptoms might appear in DC patients. There are significant differences in local and systemic inflammatory responses, composition of intestinal flora between DC patients with different colonscopic scores, which provide a basis for the clinical interventional treatment for DC in patients with permanent stoma.

Blum FC, Hardy BL, Bishop-Lilly KA, Frey KG, Hamilton T, Whitney JB, Lewis MG, Merrell DS, Mattapallil JJ.	1.0	10	2931281	2020 Apr	4	2020	2020-04-01	Scientific reports	Sci Rep	Sci Rep	101563288	2045-2322	2045-2322	2020	6387	Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by a massive loss of CD4 T cells in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) that is accompanied by changes in the gut microbiome and microbial translocation that contribute to inflammation and chronic immune activation. Though highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to better long-term outcomes in HIV infected patients, it has not been as effective at reverting pathogenesis in the GIT. Using the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection model, we show that combination antiretroviral therapy (c-ART) partially reverted microbial dysbiosis observed during SIV infection. Though the relative abundance of bacteria, their richness or diversity did not significantly differ between infected and treated animals, microbial dysbiosis was evident via multiple beta diversity metrics: Jaccard similarity coefficient, Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient, and Yue & Clayton theta similarity coefficient. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) clustered SIV-infected untreated animals away from healthy and treated animals that were clustered closely, indicating that c-ART partially reversed the gut dysbiosis associated with SIV infection. Metastats analysis identified specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) falling within the Streptococcus, Prevotella, Acinetobacter, Treponema, and Lactobacillus genera that were differentially represented across the three groups. Our results suggest that complete viral suppression with c-ART could potentially revert microbial dysbiosis observed during SIV and HIV infections.	F.

In the absence of a licensed vaccine, efforts to evaluate prophylactic agents are underway. The prophylactic efficacy of a twice-daily, 550 mg dose of the antibiotic rifaximin demonstrated no efficacy against campylobacteriosis in a controlled human infection model (CHIM); however, samples from the CHIM study were utilized to assess how the human gut microbiome responds to <i>C. jejuni</i> infection, and if a 'protective' microbiota exists in study participants not developing campylobacteriosis. Statistically significant, but minor, differences in study participant beta diversity were identified during the challenge period (p = 0.002, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.042), but no significant differences were otherwise observed. Pre-challenge alpha diversity was elevated in study participants who did not develop campylobacteriosis compared to those who did (p < 0.001), but alpha diversity declined in all study participants from the pre-challenge period to post-discharge. Our work provides insight into gut microbiome shifts observed during a <i>C. jejuni</i> CHIM and following antibiotic treatment. This study utilized a high dose of 1.7 x 10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units of <i>C. jejuni</i>; future work could include CHIM studies performed with inocula more closely mimicking natural exposure as well as field studies involving naturally-occurring enteric infections.	711th Human Performance Wing, Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, OH, United States.	epublish	eng	Electronic-eCollection	Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't;research-article;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.;Journal Article	Campylobacter jejuni;Microbiota;Diarrhea;Human Infection Model;Dysbiosys	Y	Y	N	Y	N	Y	2	Y	Y	Y	N	Y	cc by	Y	bioproject;gen;nct	2021-09-17	2021-09-18	2021-09-16	2021-10-19	2021-08-31	2021-08-31	https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.702047	https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8439579	https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8439579?pdf=render	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/webservices/rest/PMC8439579/fullTextXML	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/webservices/rest/PMC8439579/supplementaryFiles?includeInlineImage=yes	http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_package/9f/7a/PMC8439579.tar.gz
